## About

<strong>Ecoleta</strong> is a web application to help people find collection points for recycling.

This application was built on the <strong>Next Level Week Starter</strong> track distributed by [Rocketseat] (https://rocketseat.com.br/). The idea of ​​creating an application focused on the environment arose from the coincidence of the course date and the date of the <strong>environment week</strong>
